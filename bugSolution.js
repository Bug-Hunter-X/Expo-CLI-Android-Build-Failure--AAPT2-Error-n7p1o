The root cause of AAPT2 errors is often subtle issues within the project's Android resources.  Common culprits include:

* **Invalid XML in layout files:** Check all XML files for proper syntax, especially in `res/layout` and similar directories.
* **Missing resources:** Verify all referenced resources (images, drawables, etc.) exist and are correctly named.
* **Duplicate resource IDs:** Ensure resource IDs (e.g., `@+id/myButton`) are unique.
* **Incorrect resource paths:** Double-check paths in XML files referencing resources.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Clean the build cache:** `expo prebuild --clean`
2. **Carefully inspect Android resource files:** Examine all XML files and image assets in the `android` directory of your project. Look for typos, missing closing tags, or incorrect attribute values.
3. **Rebuild:** Try running the build command again: `expo build:android`
4. **Check Android Build Logs:** Pay close attention to the complete error message and the stack trace provided in the log, often containing specific file names and error codes.
5. **Use a linter:** Consider using a linter to analyze XML files and highlight potential problems.
